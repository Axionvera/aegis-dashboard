/**
 * Asset lifecycle state machine for RWA tokens. (Issue #30)
 *
 * Models the *issuer-controlled operational stage* of an already-minted RWA
 * asset (active / paused / matured / redeemed / defaulted). This is distinct
 * from two things that already exist elsewhere in this codebase and are
 * NOT duplicated here:
 *
 *  - `src/fixtures/issuer.ts` `IssuanceRequest.status` — the PRE-mint
 *    approval workflow (draft/pending/approved/minted/rejected). Lifecycle
 *    state only begins once an asset reaches 'minted' there.
 *  - `src/lib/eligibility.ts` — per-wallet TRANSFER eligibility. Lifecycle
 *    state is asset-wide and issuer-driven; a paused asset will usually also
 *    affect eligibility (via the existing `assetPaused` flag), but this
 *    module does not compute eligibility itself.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (compliance wording): lifecycle state reflects issuer-reported
 * status, not a legal or financial determination about the asset or its
 * performance. See docs/asset-lifecycle-status.md.
